# Legacy Business Improvements Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Based on Comprehensive Legacy Analysis

### âœ… Already Implemented
1. **Purchase Entry Balance Filter**: Records with 0 balance are filtered out
2. **Cashbook Integration**: Basic cashbook functionality working
3. **Modern UI**: Responsive design with gradient headers
4. **Real-time Updates**: Live stats in purchase/sale entry

### ðŸ”§ Immediate Improvements Needed

#### 1. Enhanced Balance Calculations
**Current Issue**: Balance calculations may not fully align with legacy logic
**Solution**: Implement proper credit-based balance calculations

```python
# Party Balance = Total Sales - Total Payments Received
# Inventory Balance = Total Purchases - Total Sales
```

#### 2. Improved Cashbook Integration
**Current Issue**: Cashbook entries not properly linked to sales
**Solution**: Create proper relationships between sales and payments

#### 3. Ledger Management
**Current Issue**: Missing comprehensive ledger functionality
**Solution**: Implement full ledger system with running balances

#### 4. Party Credit Management
**Current Issue**: No credit limits or comprehensive party management
**Solution**: Add credit limits and enhanced party tracking

#### 5. Year-Based Data Organization
**Current Issue**: No year-based data separation
**Solution**: Implement year-based data organization
